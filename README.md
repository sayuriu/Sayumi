# Sayumi
*"A maid, for everyone."*</br>
This is the repository of TypeScript migration from "Sayumi_JavaScript", utilizing Discord.js version 13 API.</br>
Intended as a multi-purpose Discord bot with most commands from all DJS library can offer, also with utilities to support developer side.</br>

Current repo ver: [1.36.072321b](https://github.com/u-sayuri/Sayumi/commit/2c2e42695d2af13939c9854fd0aee4c2dbfb080c)</br>
Current stage: Inheritance (You can check out the old code [here.](https://github.com/u-sayuri/Sayumi_JavaScript))
## Current bugs and TODOs
`cmd:help` navigation system bugs</br>
`cmd:help` missing nav buttons for paged embeds</br>
`cmd:eval` options to display inspect depth</br>
`cmds` inherit</br>
`internal:clock` resize problems with `process.stdout` not firing `resize` event</br>
